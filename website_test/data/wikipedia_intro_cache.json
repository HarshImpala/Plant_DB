  "alpinia_purpurata": "Alpinia purpurata, commonly referred to as red ginger, ostrich plume and pink cone ginger, is a ginger native to Maluku and the southwest Pacific islands. In typical ginger fashion, A. purpurata is a rhizomatous plant, spreading underground in a horizontal growth habit, sending feeder roots downwards into the substrate and sprouting leafy vertical stems from nodes located along the rhizome. As its common name implies, red ginger blooms with showy inflorescences on long, bright magenta- to red-hued bracts; while they appear to be a blossom, bracts are in fact modified leaves that contain the plant's actual flowers. Bracts are a common feature of many botanical genera (such as Euphorbia sp. or the Araceae family), having evolved to protect and resemble the flowers and appeal to pollinators. The actual flower \"parts\" (pollen, pistil, stamen, etc.) are located inside, often accessed by crawling insects like ants or beetles. Red ginger has several cultivars, such as A. purpurata 'Jungle King' and 'Jungle Queen'. The plant grows in many regions outside of its native southwest Pacific islands, including the countries and territories of Dominica, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hawaii, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname (where its Dutch name is bokkepoot, or \"billy-goat's foot\") and Trinidad and Tobago, in addition to several Central American nations, including Belize and Panama. It is also found in Samoa, where it is the national flower, locally called teuila. Red ginger can also be grown successfully in the United States, in places such as South Florida and coastal Southern California, as these regions' winter low temperatures do not typically reach freezing, usually dropping no lower than 45°-50 °F (about 7°-10 °C) at the coldest points of the year. Additionally, the plant may require extra overhead sun protection, as well as irrigation, in drier, hotter or sunnier climes outside its native range; as with many ginger species, red ginger prefers partial shade, indirect light and consistently moist—but not saturated—soil conditions, with preferably high levels of ambient humidity. If care is provided that the leaves do not sunburn, the red ginger can tolerate a few hours of full sun, earlier in the day. Extra light may help to stimulate more vivid foliage and vibrant blooms. In addition to planting in outdoor landscapes, red ginger may also be grown as an indoor houseplant (if provided with adequate light exposure). It can be successfully conditioned to grow in LECA or PON (in full, passive or semi-hydroponic setups). Its cut flowers and leaves are often used in floral arrangements and tropical bouquets. In Hawaii, the flowers of red ginger are grown commercially for sale, and have been associated with the Hamakua area for a long time. Once a very common flower regionally, the gardening community there has experienced a slight decline in recent years, though is starting to make a comeback. Red ginger blooms are also, sometimes, called \"graveyard flowers\" as they are customarily placed at loved ones' headstones, lasting for quite a while thanks to their vigor & long shelf-life as a cut flower.",

  "coconut": "The coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm family (Arecaceae) and the only living species of the genus Cocos. The term \"coconut\" (or the archaic \"cocoanut\") can denote the whole coconut palm tree or the large hard fruit. Originally native to Central Indo-Pacific, they are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions. The coconut tree provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials. The inner flesh of the mature fruit forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconut endosperm contains a large quantity of a liquid, \"coconut water\". Mature coconuts can be processed for oil and coconut milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra, and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and in soaps and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar. The hard shells, fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves are used to make a products for furnishing and decoration. The coconut has cultural and religious significance for Austronesian peoples, appearing in their mythologies, songs, and oral traditions. It has religious significance in South Asian cultures, where it is used in Hindu rituals including weddings and worship. The species evolved in the central Indo-Pacific. It was domesticated by Austronesian peoples in Island Southeast Asia and spread during the Neolithic via their seaborne migrations as far east as the Pacific Islands, and as far west as Madagascar. The species played a critical role in their long sea voyages by providing a portable source of food and water, as well as building materials for outrigger boats. Coconuts were spread much later along the coasts of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans by South Asian, Arab, and from the 16th century by European sailors. Based on these introductions, the species can be divided into Pacific and Indo-Atlantic types. The Indo-Atlantic type was introduced to the Americas during the colonial era in the Columbian exchange, while Austronesian sailors appear to have introduced Pacific coconuts to Panama in pre-Columbian times. Trees can grow up to 30 metres (100 feet) tall and can yield up to 75 fruits per year, though fewer than 30 is more typical. They are intolerant to cold and prefer copious precipitation and full sunlight. Many insect pests and diseases affect commercial production.

It is native to west and southwest Africa, specifically the area between Angola and The Gambia; the species name, guineensis, refers to the name for the area called Guinea, and not the modern country Guinea now bearing that name. The species is also now naturalised in Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Central America, Cambodia, the West Indies, and several islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The closely related American oil palm E. oleifera and a more distantly related palm, Attalea maripa, are also used to produce palm oil. E. guineensis was domesticated in West Africa along the south-facing Atlantic coast. There is insufficient documentation and as of 2019 insufficient research to make any guesses as to when this occurred. Human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years in Egypt; in the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered palm oil in a tomb at Abydos, Egypt, dating back to 3000 BCE (but this information needs further investigation, due to recent reviews. The oil found in Abydos may be just date oil or even animal fats). It is the principal source of palm oil.

  "ginger": "Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or ginger, is widely used as a spice and a folk medicine. It is an herbaceous perennial that grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) about one meter tall, bearing narrow leaf blades. The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots. Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste. Ginger has been used in traditional medicine in China, India and Japan for centuries, and as a modern dietary supplement. Ginger may offer benefits over placebo for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but there is no good evidence that it helps with nausea during chemotherapy. It remains uncertain whether ginger is effective for treating any disease. In 2023, world production of ginger was 4.9 million tonnes, led by India with 45% of the total."
