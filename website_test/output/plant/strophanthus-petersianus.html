                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Strophanthus petersianus, commonly known as sand forest poison rope, is a liana or deciduous shrub up to 15 metres (50 ft) long, with a stem diameter up to 10 centimetres (4 in). Its fragrant flowers feature a white corolla, sometimes with reddish pink stripes on the inside. Strophanthus petersianus has been used as arrow poison and by the Zulu as a charm against evil. Its habitat is coastal forest and rocky woodland. It is native to countries from Kenya south to South Africa.</p>
